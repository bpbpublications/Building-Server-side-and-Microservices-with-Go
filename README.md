# Building Server-side and Microservices with Go

Building Modern Backends and Microservices Using Go, Docker and Kubernetes

This is the repository for [Building Server-side and Microservices with Go](hhttps://in.bpbonline.com/products/building-server-side-and-microservices-with-go?_pos=1&_sid=89e6ce7b7&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications.

## About the Book
'Building Server-side and Microservices with Go' teaches you the fundamentals of Go programming languages, REST server applications, and microservices. You can develop efficient server-side applications and use modern development concepts such as microservices after reading this book.

We will create simple server-side applications and add new features as and when a new topic is covered. We will begin with the fundamentals of Go programming languages, which will create simple server-side applications. During development, a layered design will be introduced, with each application layer serving a specific purpose. We will introduce you to the microservice concept, and it is further divided into a couple of smaller microservices. Finally, we'll look at how to use Docker and Kubernetes to deploy and scale microservices.

After reading this book, we will be able to successfully develop monolithic and microservice applications and identify when one approach is more appropriate than another. This book can also help improve existing applications. It is a perfect handy guide to build proficiency with Docker and Kubernetes.
